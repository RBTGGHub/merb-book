	<p>Welcome to the Merb Open Source Book. The purpose of this book is simple: guide beginner and advance users through the Merb Framework.</p>
	<p>In all honesty, This book won't answer all your questions about Merb, Ruby and unfortunately won't cover all the use case. However will the help of the Ruby Community, we will be able to cover most of what you need to use Merb on a daily basis.</p>
